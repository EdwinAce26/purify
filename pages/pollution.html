    <h3> land pollutiom  </h3>
     <p>  Land can become polluted by household garbage and by industrial waste. In 2010, 
     Americans produced about 250 million tons (226.8 million kilograms) of garbage, consisting of product packaging, grass clippings, furniture, clothing, bottles, food scraps, newspapers, appliances, paint and batteries. 
     That's about 4.3 pounds (1.95 kg) of waste per person per day, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). A little over half of the waste — 54 percent — is gathered in landfills. 
     Only about 34 percent is recycled, which is about double the amount recycled in 1980, according to the American Society of Civil Engineers. </p>
