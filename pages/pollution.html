    <h3> Land pollution  </h3>
     <p>  "Land can become polluted by household garbage and by industrial waste. In 2010, 
     Americans produced about 250 million tons (226.8 million kilograms) of garbage, consisting of product packaging, grass clippings, furniture, clothing, bottles, food scraps, newspapers, appliances, paint and batteries. 
     That's about 4.3 pounds (1.95 kg) of waste per person per day, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). A little over half of the waste — 54 percent — is gathered in landfills. 
     Only about 34 percent is recycled, which is about double the amount recycled in 1980, according to the American Society of Civil Engineers." -http://www.livescience.com/22728-pollution-facts.html </p>    
    
    <h3> Water pollution </h3>
    <p> "Water pollution happens when chemicals or dangerous foreign substances are introduced to water, including chemicals, sewage, pesticides and fertilizers from agricultural runoff, or metals like lead or mercury. 
    According to the EPA, 44 percent of assessed stream miles, 64 percent of lakes and 30 percent of bay and estuarine areas are not clean enough for fishing and swimming. 
    The EPA also states that the most common contaminants in the United States are bacteria, mercury, phosphorus and nitrogen. 
    These come from the most common sources of contaminants, which include agricultural runoff, air deposition, water diversions and channelization of streams."-http://www.livescience.com/22728-pollution-facts.html 
    </p>
     
     
     <h3> Air pollution </h3>
    <p> "The air we breathe has a very exact chemical composition; 99 percent of it is made up of nitrogen, oxygen, water vapor and inert gases. 
    Air pollution occurs when things that aren’t normally there are added to the air.
    A common type of air pollution happens when people release particles into the air from burning fuels.
    This pollution looks like soot, containing millions of tiny particles, floating in the air."-http://www.livescience.com/22728-pollution-facts.html
