      <h1>About the creators of this page!</h1>
      <p>HI! Our names are Edwin, Rose, Akeeme, Jordin, Kenneth and Jose(taco guy). We attend Pathways Into Technology Early College High School (PTECH). Our age range is from 13-17. We are from Hispanic, Jamaican, American, and Mexican descent. We are very interested in coding. We were very happy when ScriptEd came to our school because it could help us understand the 
      neccesary things we would need later on in life to help pursue our careers in the field of Technology. We consider ourselves as excellent coders. The most experience someone in our group has is 6 years and that is Edwin. Most of the people in our group are first time coders. We hope that we inspired people to be the change in their community!</p>
